# 


The Cutey **Balance Projector** is a machine learning toolkit for federal budget execution & finance implemented in Python. It empowers data scientists, budget analysts, and federal agency personnel to train, compare, and visualize multiple regression models for **forecasting the balances of federal appropriation accounts**. Built using `Scikit`, `TensorFlow`, and `PyTorch`, the notebook integrates structured budget execution data‚Äîsuch as SF-133 reports from OMB and agency-specific datasets from Data.gov‚Äîto inform predictive models across multiple federal financial scenarios.

## üöÄ Features

### üîç End-to-End Forecasting Workflow

Balance Projector provides a complete pipeline from raw data ingestion to model deployment, including:

- **Data Cleaning & Normalization**: Built-in functions allow for preprocessing of SF-133 data, including handling missing values, filtering TAS codes, and aggregating over fiscal quarters or years.
- **Feature Engineering Templates**: Add lag features, growth rates, fiscal flags (e.g., end-of-year), and obligation-to-appropriation ratios with reusable code blocks.
- **Time-Aware Modeling Support**: While inherently tabular, Balance Projector supports datasets structured as rolling fiscal snapshots, making it viable for time series forecasting over fixed federal periods (e.g., P01‚ÄìP12).

---

### üßæ Federal Dataset Integration Templates

Custom code templates are included for parsing and aligning:

- **OMB SF-133 Reports**: Join by TAS or Account A and reshape to fiscal month/quarter granularity.
- **MAX Schedule-X**: Capture enacted budget data and program activity descriptions.
- **GTAS Trial Balances**: Align actual trial balances by fiscal year and subfunction codes.
- **Apportionment Snapshots**: For agencies using internal XML-based budget execution reports.

All templates are provided using `pandas` and are notebook-integrated with placeholder paths.

---

### üßÆ Multi-Model Performance Comparison

Models are evaluated using a consistent schema with a visual and tabular dashboard for:

- MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R¬≤ across all accounts
- Dynamic bar plots sorted by error metrics
- Actual vs. predicted overlays and error bands

Future enhancements will support model confidence intervals and budget violation detection.

---

### üß† Regulatory Context-Aware Modeling

The models are aligned with federal fiscal law and budget practice, allowing for:

- Modeling **Expired vs. Unexpired balances**
- Use of **Period of Availability** to segment funding windows
- Tracking **Obligational Authority**, **Reapportioned Amounts**, and **Transfer-In/Transfer-Out**

This makes Balance Projector suitable for use by:

- **Agency Budget Formulation Teams**
- **OIG Auditors**
- **Congressional Appropriation Staff**

---


### üß† Model Benchmarking Framework
Balance Projector implements and compares the following regression models:

| Model                        | Module                              |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression           | `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` |
| Random Forest Regressor     | `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor` |
| Gradient Boosting Regressor | `sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` |

Each model is trained using unified logic for fair and comparable evaluation across time series-structured or tabular datasets.

---

### üìä Forecasting Federal Account Balances

Balance Projector is purpose-built to support the **federal appropriations community** by forecasting balances in Treasury accounts based on data from:

- **OMB SF-133**: Status of Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources
- **Account A** (from `MAX A-11` or Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol tables)
- **Agency-submitted apportionments and execution reports**
- **Publicly accessible datasets from [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)**, including:
  - GTAS (Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System)
  - USAspending
  - Budget Object Class and Program Activity by Treasury Account

#### üì¶ What This Means in Practice

- The notebook is pre-structured to ingest **SF-133 extracts** in tabular CSV format. Key fields include:
  - `Treasury Account Symbol (TAS)`
  - `Period of Availability`
  - `Obligations`, `Outlays`, `Unobligated Balances`, `Appropriations`, etc.
- Forecasts can be made at:
  - **Account level (e.g., 012-1234)** using aggregated totals
  - **Budget Object Class (BOC) level**
  - **Program Activity level**
  - **Quarterly, Monthly, or Annual** time frequencies

- The models can be trained to predict:
  - Future unobligated balances (for expired or current-year accounts)
  - Fiscal year close-out positions
  - Anticipated outlays or expenditure curves

This makes the Balance Projector highly useful for:
- **Accountants and Budget Officers** projecting funding needs or lapsing balances
- **OMB/Agency Analysts** building models for apportionments or reprogrammings
- **Inspectors General or Auditors** analyzing obligation trends

### üìä Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics
- **R¬≤ Score** ‚Äì Measures variance explained
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** ‚Äì Average prediction error
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** ‚Äì Penalizes larger errors
- **Residual analysis and plots**
- **Model comparison summaries**

---

### üìÅ Flexible Dataset Input
- Accepts both default examples and custom CSVs
- Auto-preprocessing compatible with `pandas`
- Structured to allow easy injection of Treasury Account Symbols or SF-133 data

---

### üìà Visual Analytics
- Side-by-side actual vs. predicted plots
- Residual scatter charts
- Metric bar plots across models

---

### üß∞ Modular and Extensible
- Add regressors in less than 10 lines of code
- Separate training, prediction, and evaluation logic
- Easy to integrate with other government financial models
